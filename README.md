[Watch a 90 second explanation here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32hAim6Y6K4&feature=youtu.be)

Accompanies the [technocrat-signal](https://github.com/xrd/technocrat-signal) project from the O'Reilly webcast ["Building Slackbots with Hubot in a Docker Playground"](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/e/3711)

NB: As of right now, this simulates the final step of polling and putting out the technocrat signal. The need to do the webcast trumped finalizing the code. Stay tuned..
